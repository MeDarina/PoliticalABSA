AG-positive	US-neutral	GRP-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE89	HOLT : Secretary Clinton , would you like to respond ?	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE90	CLINTON : Well , I think that trade is an important issue .	AG-neutral	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE91	CLINTON : Of course , we are 5 percent of the world 's population ; we have to trade with the other 95 percent .	NONE	US-neutral	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE92	CLINTON : And we need to have smart , fair trade deals .	AG-positive	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE93	CLINTON : We also , though , need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions .	AG-neutral	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE94	CLINTON : And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE95	CLINTON : In fact , it would be the most extreme version , the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we 've ever had .	NONE	US-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE96	CLINTON : I call it trumped-up trickle-down , because that 's exactly what it would be .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE97	CLINTON : That is not how we grow the economy .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE98	CLINTON : We just have a different view about what 's best for growing the economy , how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE99	CLINTON : I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE100	CLINTON : I understand that .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE101	CLINTON : You know , Donald was very fortunate in his life , and that 's all to his benefit .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-positive	NONE	NONE102	CLINTON : He started his business with $ 14 million , borrowed from his father , and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people , the better off we 'll be and that everything will work out from there .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE103	CLINTON : I do n't buy that .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE104	CLINTON : I have a different experience .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE105	CLINTON : My father was a small-businessman .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE106	CLINTON : He worked really hard .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE107	CLINTON : He printed drapery fabrics on long tables , where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE108	CLINTON : And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class , the more we can invest in you , your education , your skills , your future , the better we will be off and the better we 'll grow .	AG-neutral	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE109	CLINTON : That 's the kind of economy I want us to see again .	AG-neutral	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE110	HOLT : Let me follow up with Mr. Trump , if you can .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE111	HOLT : You 've talked about creating 25 million jobs , and you 've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE112	HOLT : How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas ?	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE113	HOLT : How , specifically , are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back ?	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE114	TRUMP : Well , for one thing - and before we start on that - my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 , and I built it into a company that 's worth many , many billions of dollars , with some of the greatest assets in the world , and I say that only because that 's the kind of thinking that our country needs .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-positive	NONE115	TRUMP : Our country 's in deep trouble .	NONE	US-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE116	TRUMP : We do n't know what we 're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world , especially China .	NONE	US-negative	GRP-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE117	TRUMP : They 're the best , the best ever at it .

NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE120	TRUMP : We have to renegotiate our trade deals .	AG-neutral	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE121	TRUMP : And , Lester , they 're taking our jobs , they 're giving incentives , they 're doing things that , frankly , we do n't do .	NONE	US-negative	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE122	TRUMP : Let me give you the example of Mexico .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE123	TRUMP : They have a VAT tax .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE124	TRUMP : We 're on a different system .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE125	TRUMP : When we sell into Mexico , there 's a tax .	NONE	US-neutral	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE126	TRUMP : When they sell in - automatic , 16 percent , approximately .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE127	TRUMP : When they sell into us , there 's no tax .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE128	TRUMP : It 's a defective agreement .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE129	TRUMP : It 's been defective for a long time , many years , but the politicians have n't done anything about it .	NONE	US-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE130	TRUMP : Now , in all fairness to Secretary Clinton - yes , is that OK ? Good .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE131	TRUMP : I want you to be very happy .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE132	TRUMP : It 's very important to me .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE133	TRUMP : But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton , when she started talking about this , it was really very recently .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE134	TRUMP : She 's been doing this for 30 years .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE135	TRUMP : And why has n't she made the agreements better ?	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE136	TRUMP : The NAFTA agreement is defective .	NONE	US-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE137	TRUMP : Just because of the tax and many other reasons , but just because of the fact ...	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE138	HOLT : Let me interrupt just a moment , but ...	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE139	TRUMP : Secretary Clinton and others , politicians , should have been doing this for years , not right now , because of the fact that we 've created a movement .	NONE	US-negative	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	SELF-positive	NONE140	TRUMP : They should have been doing this for years .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE141	TRUMP : What 's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is - look , we owe $ 20 trillion .	NONE	US-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE142	TRUMP : We cannot do it any longer , Lester .	NONE	US-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE143	HOLT : Back to the question , though .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE144	HOLT : How do you bring back - specifically bring back jobs , American manufacturers ?	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE145	HOLT : How do you make them bring the jobs back ?	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE146	TRUMP : Well , the first thing you do is do n't let the jobs leave .	AG-neutral	US-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE147	TRUMP : The companies are leaving .	NONE	US-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE148	TRUMP : I could name , I mean , there are thousands of them .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE149	TRUMP : They 're leaving , and they 're leaving in bigger numbers than ever .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE150	TRUMP : And what you do is you say , fine , you want to go to Mexico or some other country , good luck .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE151	TRUMP : We wish you a lot of luck .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE152	TRUMP : But if you think you 're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax , you 're wrong .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE153	TRUMP : And once you say you 're going to have to tax them coming in , and our politicians never do this , because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave , because in many cases , they own the companies .	NONE	US-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE154	TRUMP : So what I 'm saying is , we can stop them from leaving .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE155	TRUMP : We have to stop them from leaving .	AG-neutral	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE156	TRUMP : And that 's a big , big factor .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE157	HOLT : Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE158	CLINTON : Well , let 's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE159	CLINTON : We had the worst financial crisis , the Great Recession , the worst since the 1930s .	NONE	US-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE160	CLINTON : That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy , failed to invest in the middle class , took their eyes off of Wall Street , and created a perfect storm .	NONE	US-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE161	CLINTON : In fact , Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis .	NONE	US-negative	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE162	CLINTON : He said , back in 2006 , " Gee , I hope it does collapse , because then I can go in and buy some and make some money .

NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE166	CLINTON : Five million people lost their homes .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE167	CLINTON : And $ 13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE168	CLINTON : Now , we have come back from that abyss .	NONE	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE169	CLINTON : And it has not been easy .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE170	CLINTON : So we 're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy , but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place .	AG-neutral	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE171	CLINTON : Independent experts have looked at what I 've proposed and looked at what Donald 's proposed , and basically they 've said this , that if his tax plan , which would blow up the debt by over $ 5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy , were to go into effect , we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE172	CLINTON : They 've looked at my plans and they 've said , OK , if we can do this , and I intend to get it done , we will have 10 million more new jobs , because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy .	AG-positive	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-positive	NONE173	CLINTON : Take clean energy .

AG-neutral	US-neutral	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE183	CLINTON : And here 's what we can do .	AG-neutral	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE184	CLINTON : We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels .

NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE479	CLINTON : And I think there may be a couple of reasons .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE480	CLINTON : First , maybe he 's not as rich as he says he is .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE481	CLINTON : Second , maybe he 's not as charitable as he claims to be .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE482	CLINTON : Third , we do n't know all of his business dealings , but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $ 650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks .	NONE	US-neutral	GRP-neutral	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE483	CLINTON : Or maybe he does n't want the American people , all of you watching tonight , to know that he 's paid nothing in federal taxes , because the only years that anybody 's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license , and they showed he did n't pay any federal income tax .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE484	TRUMP : That makes me smart .

NONE	US-negative	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE486	CLINTON : And I think probably he 's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are , because it must be something really important , even terrible , that he 's trying to hide .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE487	CLINTON : And the financial disclosure statements , they do n't give you the tax rate .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE488	CLINTON : They do n't give you all the details that tax returns would .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE489	CLINTON : And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE490	CLINTON : And I have no reason to believe that he 's ever going to release his tax returns , because there 's something he 's hiding .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE491	CLINTON : And we 'll guess .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE492	CLINTON : We 'll keep guessing at what it might be that he 's hiding .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE493	CLINTON : But I think the question is , were he ever to get near the White House , what would be those conflicts ?	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE494	CLINTON : Who does he owe money to ?	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE495	CLINTON : Well , he owes you the answers to that , and he should provide them .

NONE	US-positive	GRP-positive	NONE	OPP-neutral	SELF-positive	NONE843	TRUMP : I think you can see that .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE844	TRUMP : And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE845	TRUMP : And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country , but even for the president , in getting him to produce his birth certificate .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-positive	NONE846	HOLT : Secretary Clinton ?	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE847	CLINTON : Well , just listen to what you heard .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE848	CLINTON : And clearly , as Donald just admitted , he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage , and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions , so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE849	CLINTON : But it ca n't be dismissed that easily .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE850	CLINTON : He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen .	NONE	US-neutral	GRP-neutral	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE851	CLINTON : There was absolutely no evidence for it , but he persisted , he persisted year after year , because some of his supporters , people that he was trying to bring into his fold , apparently believed it or wanted to believe it .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE852	CLINTON : But , remember , Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans , and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy .	NONE	US-neutral	GRP-neutral	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE853	CLINTON : He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE854	CLINTON : So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE855	CLINTON : And the birther lie was a very hurtful one .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE856	CLINTON : You know , Barack Obama is a man of great dignity .	NONE	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE857	CLINTON : And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE858	CLINTON : But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention : When they go low , we go high .	NONE	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE859	CLINTON : And Barack Obama went high , despite Donald Trump 's best efforts to bring him down .	NONE	US-positive	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE860	HOLT : Mr. Trump , you can respond and we 're going to move on to the next segment .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE861	TRUMP : I would love to respond .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE862	TRUMP : First of all , I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	OPP-neutral	SELF-neutral	NONE863	TRUMP : You treated him with terrible disrespect .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE864	TRUMP : And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	SELF-neutral	NONE865	TRUMP : It does n't work that way .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE866	TRUMP : You were after him , you were trying to - you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb , very famous pictures .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE867	TRUMP : I do n't think you can deny that .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-neutral	SELF-neutral	NONE868	TRUMP : But just last week , your campaign manager said it was true .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE869	TRUMP : So when you tried to act holier than thou , it really does n't work .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE870	TRUMP : It really does n't .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE871	TRUMP : Now , as far as the lawsuit , yes , when I was very young , I went into my father 's company , had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens , and we , along with many , many other companies throughout the country - it was a federal lawsuit - were sued .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE872	TRUMP : We settled the suit with zero - with no admission of guilt .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-positive	NONE873	TRUMP : It was very easy to do .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE874	TRUMP : I notice you bring that up a lot .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-neutral	SELF-neutral	NONE875	TRUMP : And , you know , I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways , which I do n't do on you .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	SELF-positive	NONE876	TRUMP : Maybe I 'm trying to save the money .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-positive	NONE877	TRUMP : But , frankly , I look - I look at that , and I say , is n't that amazing ?	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-positive	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE878	TRUMP : Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt , but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms , and it 's just one of those things .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-positive	NONE879	TRUMP : I 'll go one step further .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE880	TRUMP : In Palm Beach , Florida , tough community , a brilliant community , a wealthy community , probably the wealthiest community there is in the world , I opened a club , and really got great credit for it .

NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE890	HOLT : Our institutions are under cyber attack , and our secrets are being stolen .

NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE893	HOLT : Secretary Clinton , this answer goes to you .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE894	CLINTON : Well , I think cyber security , cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president , because clearly we 're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE895	CLINTON : There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money .	NONE	NONE	GRP-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE896	CLINTON : But increasingly , we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states , organs of states .	NONE	NONE	GRP-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE897	CLINTON : The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE898	CLINTON : There 's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country , and I am deeply concerned about this .	NONE	US-neutral	GRP-negative	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE899	CLINTON : I know Donald 's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin , but Putin is playing a really ...	NONE	NONE	GRP-negative	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE900	CLINTON : ...tough , long game here .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE901	CLINTON : And one of the things he 's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files , to hack into personal files , hack into the Democratic National Committee .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE902	CLINTON : And we recently have learned that , you know , that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE903	CLINTON : We need to make it very clear - whether it 's Russia , China , Iran or anybody else - the United States has much greater capacity .	AG-neutral	US-positive	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE904	CLINTON : And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information , our private-sector information or our public-sector information .	AG-neutral	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE905	CLINTON : And we 're going to have to make it clear that we do n't want to use the kinds of tools that we have .	AG-neutral	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE906	CLINTON : We do n't want to engage in a different kind of warfare .	AG-neutral	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE907	CLINTON : But we will defend the citizens of this country .	AG-neutral	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE908	CLINTON : And the Russians need to understand that .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE909	CLINTON : I think they 've been treating it as almost a probing , how far would we go , how much would we do .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE910	CLINTON : And that 's why I was so - I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	OPP-negative	SELF-neutral	NONE911	CLINTON : That is just unacceptable .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE912	CLINTON : It 's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information - in administrations ...	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE913	HOLT : Your two minutes have expired .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE914	CLINTON : ... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander-in-chief .

NONE	US-negative	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE916	HOLT : Mr. Trump , you have two minutes and the same question .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE917	HOLT : Who 's behind it ?

NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE919	TRUMP : I do want to say that I was just endorsed - and more are coming next week - it will be over 200 admirals , many of them here - admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country .

NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE936	TRUMP : You do n't know who broke in to DNC.	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE937	TRUMP : But what did we learn with DNC ?

NONE	US-negative	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE943	TRUMP : We came in with the Internet , we came up with the Internet , and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much , when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet , they 're beating us at our own game .	NONE	US-negative	GRP-neutral	NONE	OPP-positive	SELF-neutral	NONE944	TRUMP : ISIS.

AG-neutral	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE959	CLINTON : It does involve going after them online .

AG-neutral	US-neutral	GRP-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE961	CLINTON : But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa , end their claim of being a Caliphate .	AG-neutral	US-neutral	GRP-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE962	CLINTON : We 're making progress .	NONE	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE963	CLINTON : Our military is assisting in Iraq .

AG-neutral	US-positive	GRP-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE965	CLINTON : But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they 've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them , foreign money , foreign weapons , so we have to make this the top priority .

NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE973	TRUMP : Well , first I have to say one thing , very important .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE974	TRUMP : Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE975	TRUMP : " We will take out ISIS. "	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE976	TRUMP : Well , President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq , because they got out - what , they should n't have been in , but once they got in , the way they got out was a disaster .	NONE	US-negative	GRP-neutral	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE977	TRUMP : And ISIS was formed .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE978	TRUMP : So she talks about taking them out .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE979	TRUMP : She 's been doing it a long time .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE980	TRUMP : She 's been trying to take them out for a long time .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE981	TRUMP : But they would n't have even been formed if they left some troops behind , like 10 or maybe something more than that .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE982	TRUMP : And then you would n't have had them .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE983	TRUMP : Or , as I 've been saying for a long time , and I think you 'll agree , because I said it to you once , had we taken the oil - and we should have taken the oil - ISIS would not have been able to form either , because the oil was their primary source of income .	NONE	NONE	GRP-negative	OTHER-neutral	OPP-neutral	SELF-positive	NONE984	TRUMP : And now they have the oil all over the place , including the oil - a lot of the oil in Libya , which was another one of her disasters .	NONE	NONE	GRP-negative	OTHER-neutral	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE985	HOLT : Secretary Clinton ?	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE986	CLINTON : Well , I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE987	CLINTON : Donald supported the invasion of Iraq .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE988	TRUMP : Wrong .

NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE991	TRUMP : Wrong .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE992	CLINTON : He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out , after actually doing some business with him one time .	NONE	US-positive	GRP-neutral	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE993	CLINTON : But the larger point - and he says this constantly  - is George W.	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE994	CLINTON : Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq , not Barack Obama .	NONE	US-neutral	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE995	CLINTON : And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops , and the Iraqi government would not give that .	NONE	US-neutral	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE996	CLINTON : But let 's talk about the question you asked , Lester .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE997	CLINTON : The question you asked is , what do we do here in the United States ?	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE998	CLINTON : That 's the most important part of this .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE999	CLINTON : How do we prevent attacks ?	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1000	CLINTON : How do we protect our people ?	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1001	CLINTON : And I think we 've got to have an intelligence surge , where we are looking for every scrap of information .	AG-neutral	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1002	CLINTON : I was so proud of law enforcement in New York , in Minnesota , in New Jersey .	NONE	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1003	CLINTON : You know , they responded so quickly , so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1004	CLINTON : And they brought him down .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1005	CLINTON : And we may find out more information because he is still alive , which may prove to be an intelligence benefit .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE1006	CLINTON : So we 've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe , from the Middle East .	AG-neutral	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1007	CLINTON : That means we 've got to work more closely with our allies , and that 's something that Donald has been very dismissive of .	AG-neutral	US-neutral	GRP-positive	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE1008	CLINTON : We 're working with NATO , the longest military alliance in the history of the world , to really turn our attention to terrorism .

NONE	US-positive	GRP-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1010	CLINTON : Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad , Muslims at home , when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community .	AG-neutral	US-neutral	GRP-neutral	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE1011	CLINTON : They 're on the front lines .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1012	CLINTON : They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1013	CLINTON : They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities , not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald 's rhetoric , unfortunately , has led to .	AG-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE1014	HOLT : Mr. Trump ...	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1015	TRUMP : Well , I have to respond .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1016	HOLT : Please respond .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1017	TRUMP : The secretary said very strongly about working with - we 've been working with them for many years , and we have the greatest mess anyone 's ever seen .	NONE	US-negative	GRP-negative	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE1018	TRUMP : You look at the Middle East , it 's a total mess .	NONE	NONE	GRP-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1019	TRUMP : Under your direction , to a large extent .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE1020	TRUMP : But you look at the Middle East , you started the Iran deal , that 's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall , I mean , they were doing so badly .	NONE	NONE	GRP-negative	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE1021	TRUMP : They were choking on the sanctions .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE1022	TRUMP : And now they 're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon , the way they 're going .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1023	TRUMP : But when you look at NATO , I was asked on a major show , what do you think of NATO ?	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1024	TRUMP : And you have to understand , I 'm a businessperson .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1025	TRUMP : I did really well .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-positive	NONE1026	TRUMP : But I have common sense .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-positive	NONE1027	TRUMP : And I said , well , I 'll tell you .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1028	TRUMP : I have n't given lots of thought to NATO .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1029	TRUMP : But two things .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1030	TRUMP : Number one , the 28 countries of NATO , many of them are n't paying their fair share .	NONE	NONE	GRP-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1031	TRUMP : Number two - and that bothers me , because we should be asking - we 're defending them , and they should at least be paying us what they 're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract .	NONE	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1032	TRUMP : And , number two , I said , and very strongly , NATO could be obsolete , because - and I was very strong on this , and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times , which is unusual for the New York Times , to be honest - but I said , they do not focus on terror .	NONE	NONE	GRP-negative	OTHER-neutral	NONE	SELF-positive	NONE1033	TRUMP : And I was very strong .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-positive	NONE1034	TRUMP : And I said it numerous times .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1035	TRUMP : And about four months ago , I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division .	NONE	US-neutral	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1036	TRUMP : And I think that 's great .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1037	TRUMP : And I think we should get - because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO .	NONE	US-neutral	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1038	TRUMP : It 's a lot of money to protect other people .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1039	TRUMP : But I 'm all for NATO .	NONE	NONE	GRP-positive	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1040	TRUMP : But I said they have to focus on terror , also .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1041	TRUMP : And they 're going to do that .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1042	TRUMP : And that was - believe me - I 'm sure I 'm not going to get credit for it - but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO .	NONE	NONE	GRP-negative	NONE	NONE	SELF-positive	NONE1043	TRUMP : I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us , in addition to surrounding nations , and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS , and we have to do it fast , when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton .	AG-neutral	US-negative	GRP-negative	NONE	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE1044	TRUMP : And believe me , you were the ones that took out the troops .

NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1064	TRUMP : That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her , because she - frankly , I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media .

NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1076	TRUMP : Essentially .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1077	TRUMP : I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto .

NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1084	TRUMP : And that was before the war started .

NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1086	TRUMP : I was against the war .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1087	TRUMP : He said , you used to have fights with me , because Sean was in favor of the war .

NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1089	TRUMP : But nobody called Sean Hannity .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1090	TRUMP : And then they did an article in a major magazine , shortly after the war started .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1091	TRUMP : I think in '04 .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1092	TRUMP : But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq .

NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE1118	CLINTON : You know , NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5 , and basically it says this : An attack on one is an attack on all .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1119	CLINTON : And you know the only time it 's ever been invoked ?	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1120	CLINTON : After 09. Nov , when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism , something that they still are doing by our side .	NONE	NONE	GRP-positive	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE1121	CLINTON : With respect to Iran , when I became secretary of state , Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb .	NONE	US-neutral	GRP-negative	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1122	CLINTON : They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration .	NONE	US-negative	GRP-neutral	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1123	CLINTON : They had built covert facilities .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1124	CLINTON : They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1125	CLINTON : And we had sanctioned them .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1126	CLINTON : I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate , but it was n't enough .	NONE	US-neutral	GRP-negative	NONE	NONE	SELF-positive	NONE1127	CLINTON : So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran .	NONE	NONE	GRP-negative	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1128	CLINTON : And we did drive them to the negotiating table .	NONE	US-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1129	CLINTON : And my successor , John Kerry , and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran 's nuclear program without firing a single shot .	NONE	US-positive	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1130	CLINTON : That 's diplomacy .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1131	CLINTON : That 's coalition-building .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1132	CLINTON : That 's working with other nations .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1133	CLINTON : The other day , I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran , and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship .	NONE	US-neutral	GRP-neutral	NONE	OPP-neutral	SELF-neutral	NONE1134	CLINTON : He said , you know , if they taunted our sailors , I 'd blow them out of the water and start another war .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	OTHER-neutral	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE1135	CLINTON : That 's not good judgment .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE1136	TRUMP : That would not start a war .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1137	CLINTON : That is not the right temperament to be commander-in-chief , to be taunted .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE1138	CLINTON : And the worst part ...	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE1139	TRUMP : No, they were taunting us .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1140	CLINTON : ... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	OPP-neutral	NONE	NONE1141	CLINTON : He has said repeatedly that he did n't care if other nations got nuclear weapons , Japan , South Korea , even Saudi Arabia .	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	OTHER-neutral	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE1142	CLINTON : It has been the policy of the United States , Democrats and Republicans , to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons .	NONE	US-neutral	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1143	CLINTON : He even said , well , you know , if there were nuclear war in East Asia , well , you know , that 's fine ...	NONE	NONE	GRP-neutral	OTHER-neutral	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE1144	TRUMP : Wrong .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1145	CLINTON : ... have a good time , folks .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE1146	TRUMP : It 's lies .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE1147	CLINTON : And , in fact , his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE1148	CLINTON : That is the number-one threat we face in the world .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE1149	CLINTON : And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material .	NONE	NONE	GRP-negative	OTHER-negative	NONE	NONE	NONE1150	CLINTON : So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes , as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-neutral	OPP-negative	SELF-neutral	NONE1151	TRUMP : That line 's getting a little bit old , I must say .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1152	TRUMP : I would like to ...	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-neutral	NONE1153	CLINTON : It 's a good one , though .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE1154	CLINTON : It well describes the problem .	NONE	NONE	NONE	OTHER-positive	NONE	NONE	NONE1155	TRUMP : It 's not an accurate one at all .

NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	SELF-positive	NONE1158	TRUMP : I agree with her on one thing .	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	OPP-positive	SELF-neutral	NONE1159	TRUMP : The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament , nuclear weapons , not global warming , like you think and your - your president thinks .	NONE	US-negative	NONE	OTHER-negative	OPP-negative	NONE	NONE1160	TRUMP : Nuclear is the single greatest threat .

NONE	US-positive	GRP-neutral	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE1162	TRUMP : They do not pay us .
